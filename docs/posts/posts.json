The lesson introduces four key ideas that underpin the randomisation test: the meaning of unusualness; chance acting alone behaviour; the omnipresence of chance; and evidence and argumentation. Students participate throughout the lesson with a mixture of hands-on and online interactions.",

Students use the Pachinkogram visual tool to explore this scenario and investigate what happens when the given probabilities change. Rather than introducing Bayes’ theorem using formulae, this lesson aims to give students an intuitive understanding of the nature and effect of given and resultant probabilities.",

Student predictions and conclusions are examined and re-examined in interactions among small group members and whole class or group and teacher. This lesson also addresses some common misconceptions relating to probability of simple and compound events.",

The data cards encourage multiple displays of the data as the students notice patterns in the data. This lesson allows students to engage in the entire PPDAC cycle.",

The students experience sampling variation and bootstrapping visually through the aid of technology and manually through a physical exercise involving data cards of a sample from a very large population. A confidence interval of the difference between two population parameters is formed and interpreted. Lastly the experience using technology is formalised.",
