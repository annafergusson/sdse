At the tertiary level, statistics, probability, modelling, and data science are taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels as disciplines in their own right. However, data and modelling or data science are ubiquitous across many disciplines (e.g. economics, engineering, linguistics, sociology) and are taught in situ. The Statistics and Data Science Educator seeks to provide free peer-reviewed teaching materials for teachers who develop statistical, probabilistic and modelling concepts in their classrooms.\r\nStatistics and Data Science Educator lesson plans identify both the statistics, probability, and modelling concepts being developed and the age range appropriate for their use. The lessons are organised around a sequence of main instructional elements relevant to the topic and type of lesson design (e.g. Model Eliciting Activity, Statistical enquiry process PPDAC (problem, plan, data analysis, conclusion)). Supplementary materials such as data sets, videos, online learning and teaching tools, embedded media, embedded interactive, and digital tools are encouraged. Teachers can navigate Statistics and Data Science Educator lessons by age level and topic.\r\nStatistics and Data Science Educator is published continuously with accepted lesson plans being published when ready. In October each year, an editorial and acknowledgement of reviewers will be published. Contact Statistics and Data Science Educator (statisticsdatascienceeducator@gmail.com) for further information.\r\nEditorial team\r\nManaging Editor Maxine Pfannkuch, The University of Auckland\r\nWebsite and Technical Editor Anna Fergusson, The University of Auckland\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nStatistics and Data Science Educator is indebted to STEW (STatistics Education Web), its recent replacement the Statistics Teacher, and their founders, the American Statistical Association/National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Joint Committee, for sharing their material and ideas during the formation of this journal. Statistics and Data Science Educator also acknowledges the work of the Australian Curriculum Corporation Mathematics Curriculum and Teaching Program (MCTP) Chance and Data Investigations by Charles Lovitt and Ian Lowe, whose work has influenced the style of Statistics and Data Science Educator lesson plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Statistics and Data Science Educator needs your participation to be a growing resource for teachers of statistics or data science.\r\nLesson plans should follow the Statistics and Data Science Educator guidelines and template\r\nSee published lessons for examples of lesson plans and take note of the reviewer guidelines\r\nSend lesson plans as a .docx file to: statisticsdatascienceeducator@gmail.com\r\nLesson plan guidelines\r\nThe lesson plan needs to be prepared using the SDSE Lesson plan template\r\nThe lesson must have been used with a class.\r\nThe lesson ideally should include the use of technology.\r\nThe lessons should be written in a conversational style, and written in the first person e.g. I decided to ….\r\nQuestions posed to students within the lesson descriptions will be italicised by the technical editor and you are welcome to adopt this style throughout your lesson plan.\r\nLesson plans should be between 6 and 15 pages, including appendices and figures.\r\nArticles are printed with a two-column layout, so any figures used in the lesson should not have a width greater than 10cm nor a height greater than 15cm.\r\nPlease ensure that each figure is ONE single image file.\r\nPlease ensure any images used in the lesson plan are free from copyright restrictions, or are ones you have the copyright permissions for (e.g. photos you have taken yourself).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Task design has a critical influence on students’ reasoning processes, what they learn, and on how they experience and understand the nature of statistical activity and thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nLesson plans\r\n\r\n\r\nEditorials\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
